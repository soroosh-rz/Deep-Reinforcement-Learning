    "Once we have the trading list for a given set of initial parameters, we can actually implement it. That is, we can sell our shares in the stock market according to the trading list and see how much money we made or lost. To do this, we are going to simulate the stock market with a simple trading environment. This simulated trading environment uses the same price dynamics and market impact functions as the Almgren and Chriss model. That is, stock price movements evolve according to a discrete arithmetic random walk and the permanent and temporary market impact functions are linear functions of the trading rate. We are going to use the same environment to train our Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm later on.\n",
